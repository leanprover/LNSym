This files defines the `SymContext` structure,
which collects the names of various
variables/hypotheses in the local context required for symbolic evaluation.

The canonical way to construct a `SymContext` is through `fromLocalContext`,
which searches the local context (up to def-eq) for variables and hypotheses of
the expected types.

Alternatively, there is `SymContext.default`,
which returns a context using hard-coded names,
simply assuming those hypotheses to be present
without looking at the local context.
This function exists for backwards compatibility,
and is likely to be deprecated and removed in the near future. -/

/-- A `SymContext` collects the names of various variables/hypotheses in
the local context required for symbolic evaluation -/
structure SymContext where
  /-- `state` is a local variable of type `ArmState` -/
  state : Name
  /-- `finalState` is an expression of type `ArmState` -/
  finalState : Expr
  /-- `runSteps` is the number of steps that we can *maximally* simulate,
  because of the way it occurs in `h_run`.
  Note that `runSteps` is a meta-level natural number, reflecting the fact that
  we expect the number of steps in `h_run` to be expressed as a concrete literal
  -/
  runSteps : Nat
  /-- `h_run` is a local hypothesis of the form
  `finalState = run {runSteps} state` -/
  h_run : Name
  /-- `program` is a *constant* which represents the program being evaluated -/
  program : Name
  /-- `h_program` is a local hypothesis of the form `state.program = program` -/
  h_program : Name
  /-- `pc` is the *concrete* value of the program counter

  Note that for now we only support symbolic evaluation of programs
  at statically known addresses.
  At some point in the near future,
  we will want to support addresses of the type `base + / - offset` as well,
  where `base` is an arbitrary variable and `offset` is statically known.
  We could do so by refactoring `pc` to be of type `Bool × BitVec 64`,
  so long as we assume the instruction addresses in a single program will
  either be all statically known, or all offset against the same `base` address,
  and we assume that no overflow happens
  (i.e., `base - x` can never be equal to `base + y`) -/

  /-- `h_pc` is a local hypothesis of the form `r StateField.PC state = pc` -/
  h_pc  : Name
  /-- `h_err?`, if present, is a local hypothesis of the form

  /-- `h_sp?`, if present, is a local hypothesis of the form
  `CheckSPAlignment state` -/
