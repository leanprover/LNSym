/-- Attempt to show that we have (at least) one more step available,
by ensuring that `h_run`'s type is def-eq to:
  `<finalState> = run (_ + 1) <initialState>`

If the number of steps is statically tracked in `runSteps?`,
(i.e., it is a literal that we managed to reflect)
we check that this number is non-zero, and leave the type of `h_run` unchanged.
This means we trust that the reflected value is accurate
w.r.t. to the current goal state.

Otherwise, if the number is steps is *not* statically known, we assert that
`c.h_run` is of type `<finalState> = run ?runSteps <initialState>`,
for some metavariable `?runSteps`, then create the proof obligation
`?runSteps = _ + 1`, and attempt to close it using `whileTac`.
Finally, we use this proof to change the type of `h_run` accordingly.
