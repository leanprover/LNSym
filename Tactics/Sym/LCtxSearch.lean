## Local Context Search

In this module we build an abstraction around searching the local context for
multiple local variables or hypotheses at the same time.

The main entry point to search is `searchLocalContext`.
`searchFor` is the main way to register which patterns to search for,
and what actions to perform if the variable is found (or not found).

  /-- This should be counted as a successful occurence,
  and we should *continue* matching for more variables -/
  | continu

  and we can *stop* matching against this particular pattern -/
  | done
  deriving DecidableEq

structure LCtxSearchState.Pattern where
  /-- The type to search for (up to def-eq!).
  Notice that `expectedType` is stored as a monadic value,
  so that we can create fresh metavariables for each search -/
  expectedType : m Expr
  /-- A cached result of `expectedType`;
  this should be regenerated after every match! -/
  cachedExpectedType : Expr
  /-- `whenFound` will be called whenever a match for `pattern` is found,
  with the instantiated pattern as an argument.
  The returned `LCtxSearchResult` determines if we count this as a successful
  occurence of the pattern, which is relevant for if `whenNotFound` is called.

  NOTE: We give the (instantiated) pattern as an arg, *not* the expression that
  we matched against. This way, implementors can recover information through
  syntactic destructuring.

  An alternative design would have `pattern : MetaM (List Expr × Expr)`,
  where the list is intended to be a list of meta-variables, and
  `whenFound : List Expr → Expr → m Unit`, where we would call
  `whenFound` with the list returned by `pattern` (which has the metavariables
  that should now have been instantiated with subexpressions of interest).
  -/
  whenFound : LocalDecl → Expr → m LCtxSearchResult
  /-- `whenNotFound` will be called if no successful occurence of the pattern
  (as determined by the return value of `whenFound`)
  could be found in the local context -/
  whenNotFound : Expr → m Unit
  /-- Whether to change the type of successful matches -/
  changeType : Bool
  /-- Whether to match under binders -/
  matchUnderBinders : Bool
  /-- How many times have we (successfully) found the pattern -/
  occurences : Nat := 0
  /-- Whether the pattern is active; is `isActive = false`,
  then no further matches are attempted -/
  isActive : Bool := true

structure LCtxSearchState where
  patterns : Array (LCtxSearchState.Pattern m)

abbrev SearchLCtxForM := StateT (LCtxSearchState m) m

variable {m}

/-- register a new expression pattern to search for:
- `expectedType` should give an expression, with meta-variables, which is the
  type to search for.

  Note that, once a match is found, any meta-variables in `expectedType` will be
  assigned, and thus further matches will now need to match those same concrete
  values. That is why `expectedType` is a monadic value, which is re-evaluated
  after each successful match.
  If multiple matches, with distinct instantiations of a meta-variable, are
  desired, it's important that meta-variable is created *inside* the
  `expectedType` action.
  If, on the other hand, a single instantiation accross all variables is
  desired, the meta-variable should be created *outside*.
- `whenFound` will be called whenever a local variable whose type is def-eq
  to `expectedType` is found, with as argument the instantiated `expectedType`.
  The return value of `whenFound` is used to determine if a match is considered
  succesful.
- `whenNotFound` will be called if no local variable could be found with a type
  def-eq to the pattern, or if `whenFound` returned `skip` for all variables
  that were found. For convenience, we pass in the `expectedType` here as well.
  See `throwNotFound` for a convenient way to throw an error here.
- If `changeType` (default `false`) is set to true, then we change the type of
  every successful match (i.e., `whenFound` returns `continu` or `done`)
  to be exactly the `expectedType`
- If `matchUnderBinders` (default `false`) is set to true, we will introduce
  metavariable for any binders in a variable's type before matching.
  For example, with `matchUnderBinders` set to true, we consider a variable
    `h : ∀ f, r f s0 = r f s1`
  as a match for expected type `r ?f s0 = r ?f s1`.

WARNING: Once a pattern is found for which `whenFound` returns `done`, that
particular variable will not be matched for any other patterns.
In case of overlapping patterns, the pattern which was added first will be
tried first
