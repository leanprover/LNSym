# External Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LNSym! We greatly value
feedback and contributions from the community. Please read this
document before submitting any pull requests or issues.

### Submitting a Pull Request

**Focused Changes**: Create small, focused PRs that address a single
issue or implement a specific feature.

**Documentation**: Add relevant documentation and comments to your
code.

**Continuous Integration**: Please ensure that all CI checks pass on
your PR. During development, you can test your contribution on your
local machine by following the build instructions in the
[README.md](https://github.com/leanprover/LNSym?tab=readme-ov-file#build-instructions).

### Filing an Issue

When filing an issue, first check whether the same issue has already
been reported previously by someone else. In your issue, include
details like:

- Illustrative, minimal, and reproducible test cases
- Commit hash of LNSym that you used
- Suggested modifications, if any

### What to Expect

**Be Patient**: Reviewing your contribution may take some time!

enable code maintainability and quality, we will merge only those PRs
that align with our priorities and goals.

rapidly.
